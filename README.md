There are Two javascipt files that rely on Database, "web_storeDB" and table, "products".
1-webStore.js is the application that allows users to purchase from the store. Provided her desired item is in stock and see the total price.
2-bamazonManager.js allows the managers to:
  * If a manager selects `View Products for Sale`, the app should list every available item: the item IDs, names, prices, and quantities.

  * If a manager selects `View Low Inventory`, then it should list all items with an inventory count lower than five.

  * If a manager selects `Add to Inventory`, your app should display a prompt that will let the manager "add more" of any item currently in the store.

  * If a manager selects `Add New Product`, it should allow the manager to add a completely new product to the store.
